This application is built with Spring Boot, connected with a React app also in this repository as "React-app"
 (https://github.com/MarioHarisis/Udemy-Spring-Frameworks-Spring-Boot/tree/main/ReactApp/react-app),
 and uses MySQL as the database for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
 
 Users can interact with the frontend to perform various operations on product data, such as adding, updating, viewing, and deleting products. 
 
 The React app communicates with the Spring Boot API, which handles the business logic and interacts with the MySQL database for data persistence. 
 
 The backend is built using Spring Boot with RESTful APIs, and MySQL serves as the relational database to store the product information.
